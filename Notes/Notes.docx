The mainapp.d file is a dependency file that is automatically generated during the compilation process when you use the -M or -MD flags with g++ or gcc.

What is mainapp.d?
It lists all the dependencies of the corresponding source file (mainapp.cpp).
This helps make or build systems track which files need to be recompiled if any headers (.h files) or other dependencies change.
